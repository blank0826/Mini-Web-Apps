## Description
This web app extracts information of matches from the website [CricInfo](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-cricket-world-cup-2019-1144415/match-results) and then creates a folder for each team with pdfs for every match played by the respective team.

We receive the HTML and get the appropriate JSON data required for creating folders and pdfs. After JSON from the website we create our JSON with keeping teams as the main object and from there, we create files and then pdfs (using the [template.pdf](https://github.com/blank0826/Mini-Web-Apps/blob/master/Cric-Info%20Extractor/Template.pdf)) that hold the record of the match.

Created using **JavaScript**
